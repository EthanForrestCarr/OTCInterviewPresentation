      <h1>Housing Affordability: Otter Tail vs Minneapolis</h1>

      <ExecutiveSummary />

      <section>
        <h2>How to read this page</h2>
        <p>
          This dashboard compares a rural county (Otter Tail and its hub city, Fergus
          Falls) with a major metro (Hennepin County and Minneapolis). The first chart
          shows how median home values have changed over time. The second and third
          charts translate those prices into affordability: how many years of income it
          takes to buy a median home, and what share of income goes to rent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, higher price-to-income and rent-to-income lines mean housing is
          less affordable for a typical household. This framing is designed to help
          county staff quickly see whether local households are more or less strained
          than peers in the Twin Cities.

        <h2>Key takeaways for Otter Tail County</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This view compares a rural hub (Fergus Falls and Otter Tail County) with a
            major metro benchmark (Minneapolis and Hennepin County), so staff can see at a
            glance whether local households are more or less strained than Twin Cities
            households.
          </li>
          <li>
            The price-to-income chart answers Can a typical household reasonably buy a
            median home here? by showing how many years of income it would take. Higher
            lines signal less affordable ownership.
          </li>
          <li>
            The rent-to-income chart focuses on renters. Values approaching or exceeding
            30% suggest cost-burdened renters and can help target renter support or
            affordable housing efforts.
