      <h2>Next Analytical Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, the owner cost-burden chart raises a new set of questions for
        follow-up analysis. Starting around 2018, Fergus Falls and Otter Tail County
        shift from comfortably below the Hennepin/Minneapolis owner cost-burden rates to
        meeting or even exceeding the metro on the share of owners paying 30% or more of
        income on housing. From a data analyst&apos;s perspective, the next step would be to
        bring in more local context: parcel-level assessment or sales data to see whether
        prices are being driven by lakefront or investor activity, building permits and
        housing starts to gauge how much new supply has come online, and mortgage or
        property tax records to understand how rising interest rates and assessments are
        affecting monthly costs.

        Pairing those quantitative sources with local informationsuch as zoning
        changes, major employers expanding or closing, and any surge in short-term
        rentalswould help form concrete hypotheses about why rural owner households
        became more cost-burdened after 2018 and whether policy levers like targeted
        down-payment assistance, tax relief, or new construction incentives are likely to
        matter most.
