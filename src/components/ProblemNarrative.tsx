      <h2>Pose and Solve a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        This project is framed around a concrete question a county analyst might be asked:
        <strong>
          {' '}
          Is Otter Tail Countys housing affordability advantage over the Twin Cities shrinking, stable, or
          growingand who is most affected, renters or owners?
        </strong>{' '}
        In practical terms, county leaders want to know whether local households are facing
        Metro-level housing stress, or whether Otter Tail still offers meaningfully more
        affordable options for both owning and renting.
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer this, the dashboard combines several complementary metrics. The
        <strong> Median Home Value</strong> and <strong>Median Gross Rent</strong> charts show that
        Otter Tail County and Fergus Falls have consistently lower prices and rents than
        Hennepin County and Minneapolis across 20132023. The
        <strong> Price-to-Income</strong> and <strong>Rent-to-Income</strong> charts translate those raw
        prices into affordability, asking How many years of income does a median home cost?
        and What share of income goes to rent? For most of the period, Otter Tails ratios
        sit below Hennepins, confirming a persistent affordability advantage, but the lines
        also show whether that gap is narrowing over time as rural prices and rents rise
        faster than local incomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Owner Cost-Burdened (30%+)</strong> chart then focuses on homeowners: it estimates
        the share of owner-occupied households spending at least 30% of income on housing.
        Here, Minneapolis and Hennepin tend to show a higher and more volatile
        cost-burden rate, while Otter Tail and Fergus Falls usually sit lower, indicating
        fewer severely stretched owner households. Finally, the
        <strong> HUD FMR vs Median Rent</strong> chart compares HUDs 2-bedroom Fair Market Rent
        benchmarks to ACS median rents, highlighting where federal rent subsidies are
        roughly aligned with, or out of step with, actual local rent levels. Taken together,
        these views show that Otter Tail still enjoys a meaningful affordability advantage
        over the Twin Cities, especially for owners, but also that local renters are not
        immune to rising housing costsan insight that can inform how the county targets
        housing and assistance programs.
